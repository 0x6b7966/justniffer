justniffer captures TCP packets, reassembles and reorders them, performs IP packet defragmentation and displays the tcp flow in the standard output. It is usefull for logging network traffic in a 'standard' (web server like) or in a customized way. It can log timings (e.g. response time), usefull for tracking network services performances (e.g. web server, application server, etc.) . 

The main differences with other sniffers is:
- capture tcp/ip traffic and handle all tcp/ip stuff (reordering, retrasmissions, defragmentation). The tcp flow adjustment is performed using linux kernel code.    
- report timing informations. So it can be usefull for tracking network system performances

Justniffer put together features of stream and packet sniffers.

WHAT'S NEW on 0.3
 - no default tcp filter.
 - finer timing tracking
 - traceability of tcp destintion and source port
 - debian packaging
WHAT'S NEW on 0.2
 - No more checksum (it gives problems when sniffing some interfaces). We trust in kernel checks
 - More keywords
 - simple encoding for unprintable characters
