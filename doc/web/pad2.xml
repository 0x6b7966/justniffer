<Char_Desc_450>justniffer is a TCP packet sniffer. It captures TCP
packets, reassembles and reorders them, performs IP packet
defragmentation and displays the TCP flow in the standard output.
It is useful for logging HTTP network traffic in a "standard" (Web
server like) or in a customized way. It can log timings, which is
useful for tracking network service performance. It can be extended
by scripts. One is provided for storing all captured HTTP content
(images, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, etc) into files</Char_Desc_450>
<Char_Desc_2000>justniffer is a tcp packet sniffer. It captures
reassembles and reorders TCP packets, performs IP packet
defragmentation and displays the tcp flow and trace timings. It is
useful for logging network traffic in a 'standard' (web server
like) or in a customized way. It can log http response time, useful
for tracking network services performances (e.g. web server,
application server, etc.) . Main differences from other sniffers: -
it captures tcp/ip traffic and handle all tcp/ip stuff (reordering,
retrasmissions, defragmentation). The tcp stream adjustment is very
reliabe since is performed using linux kernel code included in a
slightly modified version of the nids library. - it reports timing
informations. So it can be useful for tracking network system
performances: for example http response time, connection time, etc.
- it can generate logs in a highly customizable way. For example it
can mimic the apache access_log You can extend traffic analisys
with scripts that are executed to each captured request/response
sequence. justniffer-grab-http-traffic is a provided example that
captures network traffic, identifies http contents (images, text,
html pages, javascript, flash, video, etc) and saves them into
files</Char_Desc_2000>

<EULA>GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, 29 June 2007 Copyright
(C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of
this license document, but changing it is not allowed. Preamble The
GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
and other kinds of works. The licenses for most software and other
practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and
change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions

License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work

responsibilities to respect the freedom of others. For example, if
you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a
fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you
received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights. Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with
two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you
this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or
modify it. For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL
clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software.
For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified
versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be
attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions. Some
devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the
manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the
aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The
systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for
individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most
unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL
to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise
substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this
provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed
to protect the freedom of users. Finally, every program is
threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow
patents to restrict development and use of software on
general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid
the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures
that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free. The
precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow. TERMS AND CONDITIONS 0. Definitions. "This
License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other
kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks. "The Program" refers
to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each
licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and "recipients" may be
individuals or organizations. To "modify" a work means to copy from
or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright
permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting
work is called a "modified version" of the earlier work or a work
"based on" the earlier work. A "covered work" means either the
unmodified Program or a work based on the Program. To "propagate" a
work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would
make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under
applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or
modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to
the public, and in some countries other activities as well. To
"convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user
through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not
conveying. An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate
Legal Notices" to the extent that it includes a convenient and
prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate
copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty
for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided),
that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to
view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of
user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the
list meets this criterion. 1. Source Code. The "source code" for a
work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications
to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a work. A
"Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one
that is widely used among developers working in that language. The
"System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form
of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form. A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential
component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific
operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a
compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter
used to run it. The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object
code form means all the source code needed to generate, install,
and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the
work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it
does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose
tools or generally available free programs which are used
unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of
the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface
definition files associated with source files for the work, and the
source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms
that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by
intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work. The Corresponding Source
need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically
from other parts of the Corresponding Source. The Corresponding
Source for a work in source code form is that same work. 2. Basic
Permissions. All rights granted under this License are granted for
the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided
the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your
unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from
running a covered work is covered by this License only if the
output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License
acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as
provided by copyright law. You may make, run and propagate covered
works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your
license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to
others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications
exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running
those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this
License in conveying all material for which you do not control
copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you
must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and
control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your
copyrighted material outside their relationship with you. Conveying
under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the
conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary. 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From
Anti-Circumvention Law. No covered work shall be deemed part of an
effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling
obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted
on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting
circumvention of such measures. When you convey a covered work, you
waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological
measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising
rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you
disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the
work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or
third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures. 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies. You may
convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive
it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the
code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and
give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee. 5.
Conveying Modified Source Versions. You may convey a work based on
the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program,
in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided
that you also meet all of these conditions: a) The work must carry
prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a
relevant date. b) The work must carry prominent notices stating
that it is released under this License and any conditions added
under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in
section 4 to "keep intact all notices". c) You must license the
entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes
into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along
with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the
work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This
License gives no permission to license the work in any other way,
but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately
received it. d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each
must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has
interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal
Notices, your work need not make them do so. A compilation of a
covered work with other separate and independent works, which are
not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are
not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a
volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered
work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the
other parts of the aggregate. 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms. You
may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this
License, in one of these ways: a) Convey the object code in, or
embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution
medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable
physical medium customarily used for software interchange. b)
Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long
as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source
from a network server at no charge. c) Convey individual copies of
the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the
Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally
and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with
such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b. d) Convey the object
code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a
charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in
the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need
not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with
the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network
server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server
(operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying
facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the
object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source.
Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you
remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as
needed to satisfy these requirements. e) Convey the object code
using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers
where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are
being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection
6d. A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is
excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need
not be included in conveying the object code work. A "User Product"
is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any tangible
personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or
household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for
incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is
a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of
coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user,
"normally used" refers to a typical or common use of that class of
product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the
way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is
expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product
regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial,
industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the
only significant mode of use of the product. "Installation
Information" for a User Product means any methods, procedures,
authorization keys, or other information required to install and
execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product
from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The
information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning
of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered
with solely because modification has been made. If you convey an
object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically
for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a
transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User
Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized),
the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be
accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement
does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the
ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for
example, the work has been installed in ROM). The requirement to
provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to
continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a
work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access
to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially
and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the
rules and protocols for communication across the network.
Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information
provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is
publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the
public in source code form), and must require no special password
or key for unpacking, reading or copying. 7. Additional Terms.
"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of
this License by making exceptions from one or more of its
conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the
entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in
this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable
law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program,
that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the
entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to
the additional permissions. When you convey a copy of a covered
work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from
that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be
written to require their own removal in certain cases when you
modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material,
added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give
appropriate copyright permission. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work,
you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material)
supplement the terms of this License with terms: a) Disclaiming
warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of
sections 15 and 16 of this License; or b) Requiring preservation of
specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that
material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works
containing it; or c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of
that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material
be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original
version; or d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of
licensors or</EULA>
